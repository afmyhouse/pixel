## Image Creation

An image in computer graphics requires a surface with two dimensions, which acts as a projection screen. Any image, in 3D, is viewed in 2D on the computer screen or on paper or canvas.
Visualization is like a pyramid whose apex is the point of vision of our eyes and which extends along the line parallel to the gaze in both height|width or x|y axes.

The result is a "projection" in 2 dimensions on the surface of a support, material or not, of the scene in 3 dimensions.
This concept of projection support is called an image plane, similar to a painting canvas. It serves as a two-dimensional image support and is the principle underlying all image creation processes: photography - on film or digitally, cinema - photograms are photographs, painting on a board, and images projected on the screen resulting from computer graphics.
