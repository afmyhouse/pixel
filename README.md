my ray-trace journey

##  What is this repository about
I'm new to 3D computer graphics, with a background in mathematics and physics learned during my university degree in electronics and computer science.
This repository is about my journey, my doubts, my problems and efforts in the process of learning 3D computer graphics.

My goal is to build a fully functional ray-tracer with as many features as possible to mimic the behavior of nature.

I am not sure what I will achieve but I am sure of my motivation and commitment to the success of this venture.
I thank 42 school, especially 42 Porto, for opening the doors to a limitless world of computing and making me a restless mind for developing computing solutions.
